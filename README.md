### Mod 6 - Capstone Project - Using Deep Learning to Predict Corona Virus Outbreak
The purpose of this project is to use a Deep Learning algorithm called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to learn and predict time series data to forecast the Covid-19 outbreak.

#### Process
The process that I have done for this project are as following:
- Using the Kaggle API to download near real-time Coronavirus data from Kaggle
- Perform EDA to understand the data
- Use LSTM to perform Regression on time series data of Covid-19
- Use LSTM to learn and predic stock price 

#### Content of this repository
- capstone_project_corona_virus.ipynb.ipynb : this is the main technical Jupyter notebook that perform all data science process of this project.
- capstone_projecct_stock_price_predict.ipynb: this is the supplemental notebook to study about the stock price and impact of coronavirus to some stocks
- Presentation.pdf : this is the executive presentation that provide the final conclusion of this project

THANK YOU!
